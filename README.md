## What's gohive?
Gohive is a tool to help manage the micro-services driven by golang. Though nowadays dockers should be the best integration friend for golang, it's still useful to run golang applications like PHP(cPanel, Plesk) does where the golang applications are small and simple.

## Install
```shell
go get github.com/march1993/gohive
```
